## Abstract concepts

Jingoh.reader provides dispatch macro function for jingoh.tester and named-readtable.

Dismatch macro `#?` allows you to write test form as if it is written in REPL.
It may worse way to write test, but written form will be better lookings especially for third person.

If you does not like using dispatch macro, you can ignore this.
