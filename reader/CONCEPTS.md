## Abstract concepts

Jingoh.reader provides dispatch macro function for jingoh.tester and named-readtables.

Dispatch macro `#?` allows you to write test form as if it is written in REPL.
It may be a worse way to write a test, but the written form will be better looking especially for a third person.

If you do not like using the dispatch macro, you can ignore this.
